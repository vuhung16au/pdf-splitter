# Offline Functionality Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Network Status Detection
- Added `NetworkContext` provider to track online/offline status in real-time
- Implemented event listeners for browser 'online' and 'offline' events
- Added timestamps for connectivity changes to help with debugging

### 2. Visual Indicators
- Created `OfflineNotification` component to show network status changes
- Added offline mode indicators on buttons and UI elements
- Implemented contextual color changes for offline mode (orange for offline indicators)

### 3. Offline Data Storage
- Used IndexedDB for storing files and operations when offline
- Added operations queue for actions performed while offline
- Implemented functions to synchronize data when connectivity is restored

### 4. User Experience Enhancements
- Maintained UI functionality when offline
- Provided clear feedback about network status to users
- Ensured keyboard accessibility in offline mode

### 5. Progressive Web App Support
- Added Service Worker for offline asset caching
- Created manifest.json for installable experience
- Implemented offline-first architecture

## Testing

The offline functionality tests now verify:
1. The application detects connectivity changes correctly
2. Files can be uploaded when offline
3. Operations can be attempted while offline without crashing
4. File selections are preserved when connectivity changes
5. Network transitions are handled gracefully
6. Interactive elements remain accessible in offline mode

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Offline Capabilities**
   - Add support for offline PDF processing (using WebAssembly)
   - Implement sync conflict resolution for files modified while offline
   - Add automatic retry mechanism for operations queued while offline

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize IndexedDB storage for large PDF files
   - Implement more efficient caching strategies in Service Worker

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add offline usage analytics
   - Provide more detailed status information about pending operations
   - Implement predictive connectivity detection

## Technical Notes

- The application now uses a context-based approach for offline state management
- The service worker caches essential assets for offline use
- IndexedDB is used for structured data storage
- Operations are queued and processed in order when connectivity returns
